        <h1>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Slyce we have a few fundamental principles:</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
          <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
          <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</h2>

        <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>

        <p>Slyce operates several websites and apps including slyceapps.com, hiiire.com, Basketball Shot Tracker HD, Reminders with Friends, and Lyricaly It is Slyce policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and apps.<p>

        <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
        <p>Like most website operators, Slyce collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Slyce's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Slyce's visitors use its website. From time to time, Slyce may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

        <p>Slyce also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Slyceapps.com blog. Slyce only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>

        <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
        <p>Certain visitors to Slyce's websites choose to interact with Slyce in ways that require Slyce to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Slyce gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at WordPress.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Slyce – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Slyce collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Slyce. Slyce does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Slyce uses cookies to help Slyce identify and track visitors, their usage of Slyce website, and their website access preferences. Slyce visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Slyce's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Slyce's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

        <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
        <p>If Slyce, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Slyce goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Slyce may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

        <h2>Apps</h2>
        <p>Apaprt from what is listed here, all Slyce apps also adhere to Apple's privacy policy which can be found here: http://www.apple.com/privacy/</p>

        <h2>Ads</h2>
        <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites or Apps may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Slyce and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Slyce may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Slyce’s sole discretion. Slyce encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
